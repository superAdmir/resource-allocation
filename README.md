# Dynamic Programming for Resource Allocation Problem in Java
In this guide, I'll demonstrate how to use dynamic programming for a resource allocation problem in operations research with a simple example in Java. The goal is to allocate a budget across a set of projects to maximize the total benefit.

## Problem Description
* Budget: The total amount of resources (money) available.
* Projects: Each project has a cost and a benefit.
* Objective: Maximize the total benefit without exceeding the budget.
* Dynamic Programming Solution
* We'll use a 2D DP array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum benefit achievable with a budget j considering the first i projects.

## Steps:
* Initialize a DP table with dimensions (number_of_projects + 1) x (budget + 1).
* Iterate through each project and each possible budget.
* Use the recurrence relation:
If we don't include the project, the benefit is the same as without this project:
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
If we include the project, the benefit is the benefit of this project plus the best we can do with the remaining budget:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - cost[i-1]] + benefit[i-1])

## Explanation
* Initialization:
We initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] will store the maximum benefit achievable with a budget j considering the first i projects.
* Filling the DP Table:
We iterate through each project and each possible budget. For each project and budget, we decide whether to include the project or not based on the maximum benefit.
* Result:
The maximum benefit is found in dp[n][budget], where n is the number of projects.
* Traceback:
To find which projects are included in the optimal solution, we trace back through the DP table.

This example demonstrates the core concept of using dynamic programming to solve a resource allocation problem in operations research.
